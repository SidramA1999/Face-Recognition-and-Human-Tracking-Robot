# Face-Recognition-and-Human-Tracking-Robot
A robotics project integrating face recognition and human tracking. Using OpenCV and deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, FaceNet), it detects and tracks faces in real-time. The system adapts to dynamic environments, ideal for security, surveillance, and interactive robotics applications.
